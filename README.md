# ⚡ Electricity Billing System (C Language)

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **menu-driven Electricity Billing System** developed using **C programming language**.
It allows users to manage customer electricity accounts by performing operations such as adding new accounts, viewing account details, updating consumption units, calculating bills, and deleting records.

The project is completely written **from scratch** using core C concepts like **structures, functions, arrays, loops, and string handling**, without using any external libraries.



## 🛠️ Features

* ➕ **Add New Customer Account**

  * Store customer name, mobile number, and units consumed

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Structures (`struct`)
* Arrays of structures
* Functions
* String handling (`strcmp`)
* Loops (`for`, `do-while`)
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)
* Basic input/output (`scanf`, `printf`)



## 💻 Technologies Used

* Language: **C**
* Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / OnlineGDB



## ▶️ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a `.c` file
2. Compile using a C compiler
3. Run the program
4. Select options from the menu as per requirement
